1. Create java files to make this code compile and run. I created the Animal abstract class, the Dog class. Completed

2. What five objects are created in the main? 

In the main the following objects were created: 3 Dogs, 1 List of Dogs and 1 comparator 

3. Can you spot the comparator constructor call? Where is the class definition for the comparator?

 The comparator constructor is in line 16, namely: new Comparator<Animal>() 
 Constructor is defined from line 16 to line 21.
